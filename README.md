# MATCHAA

What's 'MATCHAA' all about?
------------
Matchaa allows you to pit two of your closest friends against each other in a battle of Matchaness. You will finally find out which of your friends is the most 'MATCHAA'! What are you waiting for?

This is a result from [#hwkl](http://hack.weekend.my/2011/08/01/programmers-turn-life-into-a-game-at-hackweekend/) hackathon
